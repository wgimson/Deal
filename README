deal89.c deals a random hand of cards and prints the rank of suit of each. 
Boolean values are simulated in the standard C89 way, i.e. and int typedef
is made for 'bool', and 'true' and 'false' are defined in macros to be 1 and 2,
respectively. A two-dimensional 'bool' array is then initialized to 'false', 
and const char arrays rank_code and suit_code are initialized to represent the
potential ranks and suits in a standard 52 card deck. The rand(), srand() and 
time() functions of the standard C Library are used to generate random numbers,
which are taken modulo both the number of ranks (13) and the number of suits
(4), guaranteeing a random suit and rank when the resulting numbers are used as
indices in rank_code and suit_code. A fun little bit of software to tinker with.
